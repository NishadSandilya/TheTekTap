                    <p>Its winter and we all gamers are excited already to awe at the latest game titles released so far. This might be also the perfect time for someone to get a gaming laptop as new hardware releases have also been made by both the Green and the Red team. So, existing counterparts will go down in prices. On a budget? No issues, I might have just the perfect Laptop for you!</p>

                        <h2>Behold the MSI GL65 Leopard</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="rowcontent1">
                        <p class="paradesc1">MSI is one of the top brands when it comes to any gaming machine. Having their roots back to Motherboards and Graphics cards, MSI today leads the Gaming markets in terms of Laptops too. Their latest models, the GS66 Stealth, The GL65 9SC: with all the limited editions has already left so many reviewers in awe. However, we are not talking about all those. Let's talk about something cheaper today, The GL65 Leopard. Yes, you got that right, its a generation older compared to today's latest Intel's offerings. However, Intel does not seem to boost performance of their components lately, do they? Well, simply put together, NO. Benchmarks suggest, the i7 10750H is just about 5% faster in synthetic benchmarks. That means, in real world usage, that should not matter that much at all. In fact, I have the i7 9750H and it still takes roughly about 10mins to render a 2.5min 4K video file. So, if its only for gaming, at this price point, the GL65 just stands out. I mean just have a look at the packaging itself. Its fab!</p>

                        <h2>What's inside? An MSI laptop wrapped in its own glory</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="rowcontent1">
                        <div class="imgrog"><img src="All_Images/Edited/background/msi/justunboxed.jpg" alt="rog"
                                class="rog"></div>
                        <p class="paradesc2">So, this is what you will be greated with when you open the box, its wrapped properly with an MSI branded Wrapper. Apart from that, you will get the 230w Charging brick, some manuals and sadly no laptop bag, not a necessity though. The look of the laptop is what that actually entices me. Its boldly finished in black and has this red MSI logo in the center. Feels Premium! Lets move on to the actual laptop now.</p>

                    <div class="rowhead1">
                        <h2>Feels Premium</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="rowcontent1">
                        <p class="paradesc1">Right from the look of it, it screams premiumness. The bold body lines along with the MSI Dragon logo right in the center gives the laptop a very appealing look. The materials are of a good quality. The only thing I didnot like is the perforations at the bottom panel of the laptop. Its all necessary for the heat dissipation I know, however, it makes the back panel a bit fragile. You will be clearly able to see it in the next section. But looks super cool though! </p>

                <div class="rowitems4">
                    <div class="rowhead1">
                        <h2>The well Perforated Back panel + Performance</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="rowcontent1">
                        <div class="imgrog"><img src="All_Images/Edited/background/msi/back.jpg" alt="rog"
                                class="rog"></div>
                        <p class="paradesc2">The well perforated back panel aids in the cooling efficiency. However, just to keep the keyboard surface cool. Under stress tests, the system can reach upto temperatures as high as 95 degrees. Its common in India, specially in the hot summers, In winters the thermal performance should increase by some margin. Anyways, this being the common case with most laptops, even mine heats upto about the same. Nothing to worry much here. The performance is great with this one specially as this has got the NVIDIA GTX 1660 Ti 6GB in it. Modern titles should have no issues running at Ultra-High settings at FHD on this one. Esports titles will benefit from the 144Hz display of it. </p>

                    <div class="rowcontent1">
                        <p class="paradesc1">The screen is an IPS Level 15.6" screen with a 144Hz refresh rate. perfect for Esports titles. Also, the keyboard is from steelseries. If you dont know about steelseries, They make awesome keyboards. Also, at this price range, you get Per-Key RGB illumination which is just awesome. The screen is nothing out of the world, however, its good for a gaming scree. The audio is great too. Battery life is somewhat disappointing for its caliber at 51Whr. Apart from that, this is a decent laptop at an amazing price  by Amazon right now. So, dont wait longer, stocks dont last forever. Get it today at the link below, and Happy Gaming!</p>

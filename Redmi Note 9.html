                    <div class="mainbannerimg"><img width="100%" src="All_Images/redmi/DSC_6359.JPG" alt=""></div>
                    <p>In India the people seem to incline more towards the brands like Realme, Redmi (Xiaomi), Gionee, Vivo etc. instead of going with Samsung, Moto, Nokia, LG, Google or even Micromax. I am not against any of these, however, it was intriguing to know why thats always the case. After digging into it for a bit, I found out that about 80M Indians opt for a Xiaomi Handset. So, I too decided to give it a go and thanks to my friend (@prayagbaruah) I got to play with the Note 9 for a day. Here's what I found!
                    <br><br>
                    The first thing that I found was that Xiaomi uses this very clever techinque through which they basically promote their own
                    devices using various watermarks by default. This is not the only case. Even, the lock screen has these lucrative images of
                    products and facts, which when clicked, redirects to a different site with videos, ads and downlodables. This is one way
                    Xiaomi makes money. Very clever indeed. Have a look yourself.</p>
                    <div class="imgclass1">
                        <img id="b1" src="All_Images/redmi/1sttab/pic1.jpg" alt="">
                        <img id="b2" src="All_Images/redmi/1sttab/pic2.jpg" alt="">
                        <img id="b3" src="All_Images/redmi/1sttab/pic3.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                    The app package loader even is not left unaltered. After an app is installed, the ads pop up. Moreover, the MIUI is tweaked in such a way, that the algorithm will adapt to your searches and find the best suited ads for you. In 2018, Xiaomi made about $700 M from these alone. And the crappy thing is that, there is no way to even turn the ads off. 
                    </p>
                    <div class="imgclass1">
                        <img id="b4" src="All_Images/redmi/1sttab/pic4.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>See the pic above, it doesnot stop there, there is even an option to browse 'More Apps' at the bottom mid. What actually happens here is that, the MI security app is designed to scan the installed apps on a separate page/window other than the Google play page itself. Its okay but, I felt these very quirky.</p>
                    <p><b>LEAVING THIS ASIDE, LETS DIVE INTO THE ACTUAL REVIEW!</b></p>
                </div>
                <div class="rowitems1">
                    <div class="rowhead1">
                        <h2>First, lets start off with the UI</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="rowcontent1">
                        <p class="paradesc1">The UI is classic MIUI! Boxy icons with rounded-borders and funky styled animations. The appdrawer is stock android with a few overlays such as search boxes, apps, moreapps etc. other than that, others are pretty much MIUI. Nothing to complain about here. The animations are smooth but I did find some hickups here and there, specially when switching apps. Xiaomi has done a good job here. Accessibility is good and the notification panel has almost all the important controls you would ever need. 
                            <div class="imgclass1">
                                <img id="b5" src="All_Images/redmi/1sttab/pic5.jpg" alt="">
                                <img id="b6" src="All_Images/redmi/1sttab/pic6.jpg" alt="">
                            </div> </p>
                            <p>
                            <br> However, I think, Xiaomi has missed on some design elements like the permission prompt boxes. Its not designed at all and exactly like stock android. Nothing bad here, but if you plan mods, do it like a pro! The notifications too dont get dismissed when swipped in the left direction. This was quite annoying to me too. There is also no button to close all apps at once, the UI decides which apps to keep and which to remove to save memory based on priority.

                        <p class="paradesc2">The Specs say it all! Its pretty beefed up for the price actually, compared to its rivals. Like Samsung offers a SD450 at this price point which is quite inferior to the G85. These features are the reason people opt for Xiaomi more these days. Okay, Its powered by a Mediatek Helio G85 Processor with 8 cores out of which 6 are low-clocked and 2 are a higher clocked cores. There is 4GB of RAM and my one had 64GB of internal storage. Check the below image for specs: 
                            <div class="imgclass1">
                                <img id="b8" src="All_Images/redmi/1sttab/pic8.jpg" alt="">

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having a look at the benchmarks, just to prove the point here, it manages to score a decent 350 on the single core and 1350 on the multi-core performance. The compute scores are pretty decent for the price too. In terms of 3D rendering and raw performance, it didnot do so good considering, it scored only about 1330 points in 3DMark SlingShotExtreme where the frames were dropping as low as 2FPS. Again, I didnot use any GFX exploits or so. Have a look at the benchmark scores and the comparisions.

                        <p>These were all the benchmarks that I found to be useful in depicting the raw performance. I could have tried antutu and PCMark too, However, i found them too mainstream. But, benchmarks dont just say it all, do they? Well, the real world performance is quite good actually, apart from the undesired ads and some sheldom UI hickups here and there, I found the user experience was actually pretty good. I have tried the Samsung M11 too, and did find just as about the same hickups as there were in the MIUI. So, the days of samsung's laggy UI has finished I guess. I prefer the Samsung's one UI though. Its just a thing of preference. Not judging here. The battery is 5020mAh which seems a lot however, in my synthetic tests, It dropped from 100->94% in just 20mins of benchmarks. and 45-36% in about 30 mins of gaming. Which is decent and shoud last a day of regular use. It has 9watts of fast charging too. 
                        The gaming Performance is great too. The game booster from xiaomi launches automatically as soon as a game is launched. Showing the CPU usage as well as the FPS. I am not that of a mobile gamer. So, I tested just the Asphalt 9, COD Mobile, and Garena Freefire. <br><br> <b>I tried installing Fortnite, however, the device was not supported. Games run smoothly giving 30/60FPS based on the title. The device limits itself to the settings its capable of rendering smoothly. And the great thing is that this device doesnot like to heat up that easy, and even when it did, it never crossed 35.6Deg C on the hottest Point. Kudos to the efficient G85</b>

                        <p class="paradesc1"> The Build quality is one aspect where this phone really shines. It from any angle doesnot feel like its just 12K. The build is amazing. The back is finished in this gloss multigradient finish depending upon which color varient you choose. The camera module is proportionately place dead center. It just feels premium. And there is the Redmi branding there. The sides are finished in a lighter gloss finish that feels a bit grippy. The nanocoating works for about some minutes. Then, its the same old case of fingerprints appearing on the screen. <b>The front camera module has these darkened pixels about its diameter, feels like its not finished properly. The entire Build of this device along with the camera modes can be seen in my above detailed video in youtube. Go check it out!</b>The  display is of about 395 ppi with a resolution of 1080 x 2340 px. The display is a regular IPS LCD screen with a typical brightness of 450Nits and the lack of brightness is felt dearly outdoors. Protected by the Gorilla Glass 5, both the front and the rear can take up a beating without getting scratched. I just dont like the bezels, the chin is somewhat bigger in my opinion, agian no  judgement here. <b>It doesnot support HDR videos, I tried both Youtube as well as Netflix and HDR is not supported on both the platforms. The audio quality is average. Its gets loud and is quite decent for the price. It lacks high end definition, bass effect is mimicked by the extended and warm mids that makes the overall sound signature quite warm and gets muddy eventually towards 10khz. Trust me, I have played a lot with frequencies!</b> <b> <br> LETS TALK ABOUT CAMERA, SHALL WE? </b> <br> 
                        The camera is good, just dont be fooled with the Pixel count of 48MP, these things are just a gimmick in these entry level sensors. Any decent 12MP camera with a larger sensor can easily outperform these. The pictures taken are of a good quality, I would not say great, however they are not bad either. And in some areas, they simply excel. The bad, yah! its the annoying watermark at the corner. <b>Also, the images can get automatically uploaded to the Xiaomi cloud, and I dont like that as I sincerely doubt the Privacy and data protection of Xiaomi. I just recommend turning that off altogether. Below are some images, click them to view in full res also, in some pics like the umbrella, the highlights are well controlled while in the Versace bottle, the highlights were totally blown out. In low light conditions, the shutter was not effectively adjusted so the headphone image was a bit blurry. Apart from the low light pics, others are well controlled and well optimized.</b>

I mean if you are not a fan of Xiaomi, you could go for the Samsung M11 or the Moto G9 however, this Redmi Note 9 is definitely a decent device. I mean Switching from a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, I didnot feel uneasy at all using this device for a couple hours besides some UI lag, thats it.

                            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">Some of the UI elements feel just a tiny bit unfinished</li>
                            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">The darkened out pixels around the diameter of the front camera.
                            </li>
                            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">The most annoying thing to me was the ads, Cant disable them!</li>
                            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">Camera's image quality can definitely be improved, specially the ISO perf.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            I thought I would recommend you guys the Samsung M11, but, for the price the Note 9 is really good. However, if you want one, you can check it below from Amazon.
